# NumPy Theory and Practical Assignments

This repository contains both theoretical and practical assignments that I have solved to demonstrate my understanding of NumPy, a fundamental library for scientific computing and data analysis in Python.

## ðŸ“˜ Theory Questions

1. **Purpose and Advantages of NumPy**  
   Discusses how NumPy enhances Python's capabilities for numerical operations, improving performance in scientific computing and data analysis.

2. **np.mean() vs np.average()**  
   Comparison of these two functions, including use cases where one is preferred over the other.

3. **Reversing Arrays**  
   Methods to reverse 1D and 2D arrays along different axes, with examples.

4. **Data Types in NumPy**  
   Importance of data types in NumPy, including how to check and optimize them for memory management and performance.

5. **ndarrays vs Python Lists**  
   Detailed explanation of NumPy's n-dimensional arrays and their advantages over Python lists.

6. **Performance of NumPy vs Python Lists**  
   Analysis of performance benefits when using NumPy for large-scale numerical operations.

7. **vstack() vs hstack()**  
   Explanation and examples of vertical and horizontal stacking of arrays.

8. **fliplr() vs flipud()**  
   Differences between flipping arrays left-to-right and up-to-down, with examples.

9. **Array Splitting**  
   How `array_split()` handles uneven splits of arrays in NumPy.

10. **Vectorization and Broadcasting**  
    Key concepts of NumPy that enable efficient array operations.

## ðŸ”§ Practical Questions

1. **Interchanging Rows and Columns**  
   Created a 3x3 array of random integers and interchanged its rows and columns.

2. **Reshaping Arrays**  
   Generated and reshaped a 1D array into 2x5 and 5x2 shapes.

3. **Border of Zeros**  
   Added a border of zeros around a 4x4 array to create a 6x6 array.

4. **Array with Step Size**  
   Created an array with integers from 10 to 60, with a step of 5.

5. **String Case Transformations**  
   Manipulated an array of strings to apply uppercase, lowercase, and title case transformations.

6. **Inserting Spaces**  
   Inserted spaces between each character in an array of words.

7. **Element-wise Operations**  
   Performed element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two 2D arrays.

8. **Identity Matrix**  
   Generated a 5x5 identity matrix and extracted its diagonal elements.

9. **Prime Numbers**  
   Created an array of random integers and identified all prime numbers within it.

10. **Temperature Averages**  
    Generated daily temperature data for a month and calculated weekly averages.
